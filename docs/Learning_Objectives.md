# Ghidra Reverse Engineering Course: Learning Objectives & Milestones

## Course Overview
This 4-hour introductory course aims to equip participants with fundamental knowledge and practical skills in reverse engineering using Ghidra, leveraging their existing familiarity with `clang` and Python.

## Target Audience
Developers, security enthusiasts, or curious learners proficient in `clang` and Python, with little to no prior experience in reverse engineering or Ghidra.

## Estimated Duration
4 Hours

## Module 1: Introduction to Reverse Engineering (Approx. 30 min)
*   **Objective 1.1:** Understand the definition and purpose of reverse engineering in various contexts (security, compatibility, vulnerability research).
*   **Objective 1.2:** Differentiate between static and dynamic analysis.
*   **Objective 1.3:** Identify common use cases for reverse engineering.

## Module 2: Getting Started with Ghidra (Approx. 60 min)
*   **Objective 2.1:** Understand Ghidra's architecture and its core components (Project Manager, Code Browser, Decompiler).
*   **Objective 2.2:** Successfully import a binary into Ghidra and perform initial analysis.
*   **Objective 2.3:** Navigate the Ghidra Code Browser interface (Listing, Decompiler, Symbol Tree, Data Type Manager).
*   **Objective 2.4:** Identify key windows and their functionalities.

## Module 3: Basic Static Analysis with Ghidra (Approx. 90 min)
*   **Objective 3.1:** Locate and rename functions and variables for clarity.
*   **Objective 3.2:** Understand data types and how to apply them in Ghidra.
*   **Objective 3.3:** Utilize cross-references to trace code execution and data flow.
*   **Objective 3.4:** Perform basic string searching and analysis within a binary.
*   **Objective 3.5:** Interpret basic assembly code (focus on common instructions, control flow) and relate it to higher-level constructs.

## Module 4: Decompilation and Understanding Pseudo-code (Approx. 60 min)
*   **Objective 4.1:** Understand the role and limitations of Ghidra's decompiler.
*   **Objective 4.2:** Interpret pseudo-code generated by the decompiler to understand program logic.
*   **Objective 4.3:** Identify and resolve common decompilation challenges (e.g., incorrect data types, missing function signatures).

## Module 5: Introduction to Ghidra Scripting with Python (Approx. 60 min)
*   **Objective 5.1:** Understand the basics of Ghidra's Python scripting environment (GhidraDev).
*   **Objective 5.2:** Write and execute a simple Python script to interact with Ghidra (e.g., enumerate functions, find specific instructions).
*   **Objective 5.3:** Discuss practical applications of Ghidra scripting for automation and advanced analysis.

## Milestones & Key Takeaways
Upon completion of this course, participants should be able to:
*   Confidently load and perform initial analysis on a binary in Ghidra.
*   Navigate Ghidra's interface effectively for static analysis.
*   Interpret pseudo-code and basic assembly to understand program functionality.
*   Apply basic data typing and symbol renaming techniques.
*   Write and execute simple Python scripts within Ghidra to automate tasks.
*   Possess a foundational understanding of reverse engineering principles.
